* notes:
** $e_{SD}$
** b-spline inintialization
*** generation of closed b-spline
*** TODO choice of the proper parametrization scheme
*** initialization of the control points from the given point cloud
** optimization
*** calculation of corresponding foot points
**** preprocessing, the calculation of the coarse grid and normal of the coarse points on the spline
**** query

* limits:
** the representation of the spatial curve in the current implementation is the uniform b-spline, which is appropriate for a curve with more or less uniform curvature

* file list:
** misc/closest_dist_brute: calculate the closest distance between points in two point sets
** sdm/gen_init_bs: generate the initial closed ellipse for a given point set
** sdm/gen_coarse_grid: generate a coarse grid for a given point set

* todo:
** voronoi / delaunay methods to choose coarse centers
