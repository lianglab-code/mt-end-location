\section{Paper reading}

\subsection{Calculation of the distance from a point to a B-spline}

\section{Implementation}
The implementation by Yuri Pekelny is of great help. The implementation was achieved 2005.

\section{Thoughts}
By implementation the SDM algorithm, I think I could learn several things, including the acquaintance of optimization theory, some basic ideas about b-splines, and the rendezvous of matrix operations.

In the paper \cite{WPL2006}
