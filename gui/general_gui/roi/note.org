#+title: Specifications ROI/POI Module

* notes:
** MATLAB'S built-in imroi tools (/opt/MATLAB/R2014a/toolbox/images/imuitools) are great!
** However, I would like to implement my own.
** ROI, IMO, would serve two roles in two applications: segmentation and analysis. Howerer, after reading Sonka's textbook on image processing, I think I mixed image representation on two level: segmentation level and analysis level. As a result, I think I should divide the ROIs into two class: segmentation level and analysis level. Oh, how silly I am! All ROIs mentioned here belong to the segmentation level. 

* types:
** line (POI)
** polyline (POI)
** curve (POI)
** rectangle (ROI)
** ellipse (ROI)
** polygon (ROI)
** free-region (ROI) (just like imfreehand)

* common properties:
** internal representation
*** ellipse: [x y a b]
*** rectangle: [x y w h]
*** polygon: [x; y]
*** line: [p0, p1]
*** polyline: [x; y]
*** curve: b-spline
*** free-region: [x; y]
** GUI representation:
*** all are represented by [x; y]
** line width
** movable: free-region is non-movable

* operations:
** plottint methods:
*** get_pos: [min_x, min_y, width, height]
*** free-region painting (just like the painting tool in Amira)
** interaction
*** mouse clicking
**** move the whole shape
**** shape modification:
***** xy adjustment
***** b-spline control point adjustment
***** b-spline extension
** ROI/POI management:
*** add
*** remove
*** union
*** intersection
*** erosion/dilation
